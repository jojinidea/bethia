// Pointers
// * returns the value stored in the pointer address
// & returns the address stored in the pointer address
// when we declare a pointer, e.g. char *p, this means p is a variable that points to some place in memory (store address of another variable)
// p = "Hello" (stores address of this variable)
// int a; 
// int *p // a pointer that stored the address of a variable
// p = &a // p points to the memory location of a
// dereferencing - we have a pointer (that stores an address) and we want to get the value - use *
// & - get address
