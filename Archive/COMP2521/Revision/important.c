// 1. BE SUPER CAREFUL WITH ADTs, if we're ever given one with stuff like nElements, nValues, if we change this, make sure we modify accordingly otherwise the function will NOT WORK when tested!!
// 2. ALWAYS FREE anything that is allocated with malloc !! 
// 3. UNDERSTAND malloc better - when we want to dynamically allocate memory for a pointer, we need enough space to STORE the thing - sizeof(thing) * number of blocks we need 
// 4. FUNCTIONS THAT TAKE IN POINTERS as arguments - we want to pass in a MEMORY ADDRESS & (a pointer is just something that is a memory address). we want this memory address to be pointing somewhere that we can access (not an undefined location)
