// careful
// don't complicate things
// think about what to use
// if we are given an adjacency matrix/list - do we want to find out the number of connections from one node to other nodes (use it!)? 
// do we need DFS? (don't overcomplicate things though!) 
// if we are given a stack/queue, BFS/DFS?
