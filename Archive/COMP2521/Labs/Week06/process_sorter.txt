insert breaks before the for loops & after the first for loop - just to check that the values were properly initialised & n was the correct value. This was fine
inserted breaks before and after the second for loop just to check j was being properly initialied
removed these breaks
inserted breaks immediately at line 41 (after the incrementation updates)

printed out array at these indexes - confirmed that these values were not initialised
changed j++ to j--
